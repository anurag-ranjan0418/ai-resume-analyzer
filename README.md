# 🛡️ ApexResume | Neural Engine v2

**ApexResume** is an enterprise-grade resume auditing platform. It utilizes a distributed cloud architecture powered by **Puter.js** to perform non-volatile document analysis, neural metadata extraction, and secure environment sanitization.

---

## 🔬 System Architecture

The "Neural Engine" operates on a strictly-typed, high-performance stack:

* **Cloud Orchestration:** [Puter.js](https://puter.com/) (Distributed FS, KV Storage, & AI Handshaking)
* **Core Framework:** [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/) (SSR-ready Data Routes)
* **Interface Mesh:** [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (High-contrast Slate/Emerald design system)
* **Type Safety:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescript.org/) (Strict `verbatimModuleSyntax` protocols)
* **Animation Engine:** Tailwind Animate (Custom Dialog transitions)

---

## 🛠️ Operational Commands

### 01. Neural Initialization

Install dependencies and sync the local development mesh.

```bash
npm install

```

### 02. Simulation (Development)

Execute the development instance with HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

```bash
npm run dev

```

> **Link Status:** Local instance available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 03. Production Compilation

Generate an optimized, minified bundle for cloud deployment.

```bash
npm run build

```

---

## 🎛️ Specialized Modules

### `WipeApp` (System Purge)

A proprietary sanitization utility located at `/wipe`. It allows operators to:

* Perform **recursive file deletion** across the Puter Filesystem.
* Execute **KV Store flushing** to reset neural metadata.
* Interact via a **Custom Animated Dialog** (High-fidelity Slate/Red UI).

### `PDFService` (Neural Handshake)

*In Development*: Responsible for bridging raw document buffers into the Puter AI logic for 0.1s analysis sequences.

## 🚀 Deployment Protocols

### Containerization (Docker)

For scalable deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure), utilize the Docker engine:

```bash
# Build the system image
docker build -t apex-resume-node .

# Initialize the instance
docker run -p 3000:3000 apex-resume-node

```

### Artifact Structure

Post-build manifest for server-side verification:

```text
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Immutable assets (JS, CSS, Neural Favicon)
│   └── server/    # Compiled SSR logic & Puter handlers

```

---

## 🎨 System Aesthetics

The interface utilizes a custom-engineered **Slate & Emerald** palette, designed for maximum legibility during long audit sessions.

* **Primary:** `Slate-950` (The Void)
* **Accent:** `Emerald-500` (System Ready)
* **Warning:** `Red-600` (Critical Action)
* **Glassmorphism:** `Backdrop-blur-md` (Dialog Isolation)

> **AUTHENTICATION NOTICE:** This system requires a valid **Puter.js** session. Unauthorized access to the `/wipe` sequence is logged via the Network Sentry.
